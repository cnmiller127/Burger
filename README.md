# GREAT BURGER!!!
#### "Welcome to Great Burger Home of the Great Burger"

### Code

This simple full stack program uses a MYSQL Database to keep track of burgers that have been freshly prepared, and burgers that have been devoured. It uses express.js for routing of information passed too and from the SQL database. Information is sent to the front end from the DB. The display varies based on whether the burger has been marked as devoured or not in the DB.
